# MIGRENE toolbox,
## Description 
MIGRENE toolbox is an integrated pipeline for Microbial and personalized GEM (Genome-scale metabolic model), REactiobiome, and community NEtwork modeling. It enables the generation of species and community-level models from any reference gene catalogs and metagenome species to be applied to personalized microbiome studies. Using the toolbox, GEMs could be generated based on the gut microbial gene catalogs and metagenomic species pan-genomes (MSPs). This toolbox also contains functions for performing community modelling using GEMs, determining reaction abundance and richness and reaction set enrichment (RSE), and reactobiome that describes an aggregate of the metabolic repertoires of an individual gut microbiome, or the biochemical state of the microbiome and profiling the reactobiome.
