# MIGRENE toolbox,
The toolbox for Microbial and personalized GEM, REactiobiome and community NEtwork modelling 

Three tutorials shows the steps that MIGRENE Toolbox automatically generate and simulate MAGMA
(MSP Associated Genome scale MetAbolic) models and personalized metabolic microbiome data
using Bacterial gene catalog, metagenome species (MSP) and metagenomic data integration.

# three tutorials are provided in the toolbox:
note: if you have your GEMS and you need to create the personalized metabolic microbiome data
i.e. reaction richness, Microbiome, reaction abundance, community models and pRSE (personalized
reaction set enrichment), go to Box-c.

IntegrationCatalogToModel.m: Box-a|
integration of bacterial gene catalog into metabolic model to generate a microbiome reference genome
scale metabolic model (GEM).

MAGMAgeneration.m: Box-b|
calculation of reactionScore, constraining the model based on diet, species specific GEMs or MAGMA generation

PersonalizedMicrobiomeMetabolism.m: Box-c| generating personalized metabolic microbiome
